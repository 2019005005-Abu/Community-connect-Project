	  <h5>General background/ Identified problem</h5>
	  <p>
	  	We know that majority of the Indian population still live in the rural areas. But still a proper drainage system in these places is not available. Even if they are available, they are not as per the required standards.
Recently in a trip to this village from the university, we saw that the drainage system in this area is also very poor. Improper drainage facility especially in the case of this village which is in a low-lying area leads to overflowing gutters, flooding, property loss, breeding of insects, soil
