     <p>
 1.	This system can handle water from rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, rainwater to washroom water. <br>
2.	This keeps the soil around healthier<br>
3.	Maintains the water tables, helps solve the problem of drought, and saves water for different other domestic use.<br>
4.	It allows plants and corps to grow without drowning in puddles. <br>
    5.	It is affordable, lasts long and has low maintenance cost. <br>
6.	As there are no water in drains and is not dumped in open, the problem of mosquitoes and flyâ€™s is reduced. The number of diseases will decrease.

      <p>
      	A tree-foot-wide,four-foot-deep pit exist in every home. Another smaller pit that is a foot deep first filters the water. The small pit is open with small grating on it, so that the water can easily sip in. Sedimentation happens in the 1st pit. And that water moves to the other pit that has gravel that filters the water more. This pit has a covered top. Now from this big pit, there is a little separation distance between the water table. The now clean water from the big pit eventually gets added in the water table. 
       This dry pit needs a soil that can soak in water. This village that we went has the soil that soaks water so this method can be used.

      <p>India is one among the largest economic nations in the world. But it still lags in the infrastructural development. And this includes the problem of drainage systems. There is a very poor drainage system in India especially the rural areas. During our visit we saw that this particular village also has a very poor drainage system. Hence in this entire project is an attempt to improve the drainage system in this village. Through the analysis, we came up to a conclusion that dry drainage system is the best effective and efficient system to improve the drainage system of this village.

      	t allows us to support one another, interact, share experiences and our modern life struggles. Having this open bond with others is what builds valuable relationships, and gives us a deeper sense of belonging. Communities are also rich in resources. Your strengths may be someone else's weaknesses and vice versa.
